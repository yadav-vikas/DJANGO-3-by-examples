# This is the ModuleFormSet formset. You build it using the inlineformset_
# factory() function provided by Django. Inline formsets are a small abstraction
# on top of formsets that simplify working with related objects. This function allows
# you to build a model formset dynamically for the Module objects related to a
# Course object.

# • fields: The fields that will be included in each form of the formset.

# • extra: Allows you to set the number of empty extra forms to display
# in the formset.

# • can_delete: If you set this to True, Django will include a Boolean field for
# each form that will be rendered as a checkbox input. It allows you to mark
# the objects that you want to delete.
#
